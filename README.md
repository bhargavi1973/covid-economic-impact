📊 Predicting Economic Impact of COVID-19 Using Linear Regression
This project is a simplified data science application that demonstrates how public health indicators like COVID-19 case counts and unemployment rates can influence the stock market. Using a basic Linear Regression model, we attempt to predict a stock market index based on these two features.

While the dataset in this version is randomly generated for practice, the structure mirrors a real-world scenario where governments, analysts, and businesses aim to quantify the economic impact of a pandemic or similar large-scale crisis.
